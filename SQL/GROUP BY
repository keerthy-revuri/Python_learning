- GROUP BY allows us to aggregate data and apply functions to better understand how data is distributed per category

-- AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS -
The main idea is it takes multiple inputs and return a single output
- AVG(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), COUNT()
- It can be used only in SELECT, HAVING clause
- AVG() returns floating value, for precision ROUND() can be used

-- GROUP BY
---------------
- We need to choose a categorical column to GROUP BY
- syntax - SELECT category_col, AGG(data_col) FROM table GROUP BY category_col
- GROUP BY clause must appear right after FROM or WHERE
- in SELECT statement columns must have either an aggregate function or be in GROUP BY call
ex- SELECT data, division, SUM(sales) FROM customer GROUP BY data, division
