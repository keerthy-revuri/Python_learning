Python -
-A pattern is observed when while loop is used to traverse   instead of for loop
ex - convert string to list without using split, so here we have to mention condition to check space
start = 0
str_res = ''
word_list =[]
while start < len(string):
    if string[start] == ' ':
        word_list.append(str_res)
        str_res = ' '
    else:
        str_res = str_res + string[start]
    start = start + 1
- Unique email occurence problem follows same pattern - we have to traverse strings through special characters
like [ @, +, . ] and store in empty strings - local, domain (slicing methos is used)and then join both to form final string

- Merge Sort - Recursive function is used in this algorithm
- array will be split till len(array) >1
- merge_sort(L) is performed first then merge_sort(R) is performed
-two pointers - i, j will be used to sort the sorted lists
- array will be sorted at single element_level (as single elements are always sorted) then merged back

- SQL -
------------------
-When we want exact number of records same as 2 tables after Joining, they should be joined on multiple join conditions
- syntax of BETWEEN function -
BETWEEN 'value1' AND 'value2'

- partition by, order by are not mandatory in windows functions, use them based on problem

- sub query can be written anywhere in HAVING condition as well
