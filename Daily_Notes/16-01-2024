1. Connect Strings ----
-join is used to convert list to string - ''.join(list)
- Instead of using join, for loop can be used to breakdown elements in list and those can be concatenated -

2. String Palindrome -----
- travese the string in reverse using range(len(str)-1,-1,-1)
-concatenate all the characters to a empty string and compare both strings

3. char count in string to dictionary -----
PATTERN -----
-string will be converted to dictionary in this
-if a character is not  present in dictionary, give the value as 1 (temp[i] = 1)
-else if a character is present in dictionary increment value by 1 (temp[i] = temp[i] +1)

4. First repeated letter in string whose index of 2nd occurence of letter should be smallest.(geeksforgeeks ( ans - g))
The above pattern is used in this------
string will be converted to dictionary in this
-if a character is not  present in dictionary, give the value as 1 (temp[i] = 1)
-else if a character is present in dictionary increment value by 1 (temp[i] = temp[i] +1)
- whose ever value of character increases first, the 2nd occurence of that is smallest

5. First repeated letter present first in string - geeksforgeeks ( ans - g)
- convert string to dictionary
- After that, check whosever value in dictionary is > 1
or

- convert string to list
- check if first item is present in rest of the items and return it
    for i in range(len(a1)):
        if a1[i] in a1[i+1:]:
            return a1[i]
