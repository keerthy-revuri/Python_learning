SQL -
-----------
- CTE - Its is a kind of intermediate table created for more readability

- If count is performed already and then if JOIN is applied , it returns null, if count is performed along
  with JOIN operation then it returns 0


- Both coalesce, case when can be used to get 0 in result when it is null
- COALESCE(NULL,0) - it returns first non - null value
- case when distance is not null then distance else 0 end

- CROSS JOIN is used when question says result should have all values for particular columns

Python -
-----------
-  XOR - returns 0 for same values, returns 1 for 2 different vales
- number will convert into binary
1^1 = 0
1^0 = 1
ex - 2^ 3 = 01 ^ 11 = 10 = 4
