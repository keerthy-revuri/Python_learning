1. Reverse the words in a given string -

word = "i love to code"
-first reverse the individual words in the string which will be - "i evol ot edoc",
 then reverse the whole string - "code to love i"
- string - convert to list using split- reverse words in list - join words in list to form string - reverse the string


2. string.insert(0, word) - if we insert all words in a list at start position of a string,
it will not override instead the words will move towards right i.e., first word insert will be the last word in the string
and last word inserted will be the first word in string

3. string.find(value, start, end) - finds first occurence of value between start to end indexes

4. to reverse a string - there are 3 ways - using for loop, while loop, str[::-1]
-for loop - for ch in range(len(word)-1,-1,-1)
- while loop - find last index of the word(len_s =  len(s) - 1) and keep decrementing it until it reaches index 0
(mention it in while loop - while len_s >= 0)

5. Convert string to list without using split() by space

- we use two pointers start, end
- initialize start with 0, and empty word_list =[]
- find end = string.find(' ', start)---------> #note - string.find(value,start,end) - this finds  the first occurence of value between      	start and end,
 if value is not found this method returns -1
- if end == -1, then move end to the end of string -- end = len(string)
- append words to word_list --- word_list.append(str[start:end])
- assign immediate next index of end to start to continue the loop--- start = end + 1, continue loop till start >= len(string)

SQL -

1. EXISTS - EXISTS operator checks for the existence of any rows returned from sub query,
it returns true if it has any value , otherwise it returns false

2. window functions - there are 3 types of functions - ranking, aggregate , value
 these functions are performed on range of rows called windows , these windows are determined by over(partition by col order by col) clause
 -over clause will have partition by col order by col which will determine the windows
