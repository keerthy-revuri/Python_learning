Python:
------
1. Bubble Sort -
It works by comparing adjacent elements and swapping , in each iteration the largest element will be moved
towards the end(sorted)
This will be repeated till all the elements are sorted

2. Selection Sort -
This algorithm works by selecting smallest or largest element's index , and it  will be traversed
through rest of the elements and compared with minimum element , if any element is smaller that index
will be replaced with minimum element index
After the loop swapping is done

3. Length of last word -
-This problem can be solved in 2 ways - using for loop and while loop
- continue key word - the code written after continue is a loop will be skipped
- continue, break will be written only inside loops
- pass key word - it is a filler used when we dont know what to write in the code
- for loop to traverse in reverse - for(len(str)-1, -1, -1) ----(-1 is written instead of 0 as second element in range is exclusive)
-pattern learnt in while loop --- Length of last word ( make an assumption of counter=0 at the beginning of problem,
and then increment the counter until the condition fails ex: while  s[len_s]!=' ')
