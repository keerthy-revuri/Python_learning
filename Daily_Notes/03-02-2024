- Python -
- recursive function - calling the same function until it satisfies base function
- isInstance(x, list) - checks if x is of type list
- if type(x) is list - also checks if x is of list type
- even though both evaluate same, isInstance() is more flexible to check type
as it considers sub classes also (mainly useful in cases of polymorphism, inheritance)
