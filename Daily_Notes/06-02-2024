SQL -

- date_add(login_date, INTERVAL -rk DAY) as grp_date
- this will add another date column grp_date , here grp_dat e= login_date- rk

- the equivalent syntax of date_add in postgresql is - login_date - (rk || ' DAY')::INTERVAL AS grp_date

- LEAD(col1) window functions is used to access data from subsequent rows, it fetches data from the specified
number of rows ahead from the current row

- datediff(date1, date2) - gives difference between dates

- not equal to - != - <> are all same

- INNER JOIN is same as SELF JOIN if it is same table

- SELF JOIN can be written without using JOIN condition like this -
Select * from emp e1, emp e2 where e1.id = e2.id
