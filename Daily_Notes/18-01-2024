SQL -

- Co-related sub query - For every outer record, the inner query executes against the whole table with the matching condition
- Inner query is dependant on outer query
- Both tables can be same or different

- CASE WHEN -
- CASE WHEN is same as if else
- ex - case when student_number is not null then student_number else 0 end

- Always try to use INNER JOIN , LEFT JOIN first as FULL OUTER JOIN is expensive

-SELF JOIN - It is a regular JOIN , in this the table is joined with itself, It is used to compare the values
of a column with the values of another column in the same table

- CROSS JOIN - It is a JOIN operation that produces cartesian product of two tables
- Each record in table 1 is joines with all records in table 2
- No join condition is mentioned in this CROSS JOIN
- ex- select * from table1 CROSS JOIN table2
(or) - Select * from table1, table2
(or) - Select * from table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON 1=1
