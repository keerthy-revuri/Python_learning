Advantages of Stack:
1. Stacks are simple data structures with a well-defined set of operations, 
   which makes them easy to understand and use.
2. Stacks are efficient for adding and removing elements, as these operations have a time complexity of O(1), 
   because these operations always happen at the end of the list (or at the top of the stack) 
   where as time complexity of List is O(n) .
3. In order to reverse the order of elements we use the stack data structure.
4. Stacks can be used to implement undo/redo functions in applications.
5. Function calling in any programming language is managed using a stack

Drawbacks of Stack:
1. Restriction of size in Stack is a drawback and if they are full, you cannot add any more elements to the stack.
2. Stacks do not provide fast access to elements other than the top element.
3. Stacks do not support efficient searching, as you have to pop elements one by one until you find the element 
   you are looking for
